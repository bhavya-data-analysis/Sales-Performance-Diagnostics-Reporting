# A3 – Sales Decision Dashboard Case Study

## Objective
The goal of this dashboard is to support **executive-level decision making** by translating analytical findings into clear actions, priorities, and risk areas. While the diagnostic dashboard explains *what is happening and why*, this dashboard focuses on **what should be done next**.

---

## Business Questions Addressed
- Which product categories pose the highest profit risk?
- At what discount levels does profitability sharply decline?
- Which regions require immediate intervention?
- Which sub-categories should be fixed, restricted, or reconsidered?

---

## Key Metrics Used
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- High-Discount Loss Orders (Discount ≥ 30% & Negative Profit)
- Profit by Category
- Profit by Region
- Profit by Discount Bucket
- Loss-Making Sub-Categories

These metrics were selected to align with **profit-first decision making**, rather than sales-only growth.

---

## Key Findings
- A significant number of orders with discounts above 30% are unprofitable.
- Profit losses are concentrated in specific categories, particularly **Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies**.
- **Technology and Phones** remain the strongest profit contributors.
- Profit declines sharply beyond the **20–30% discount range**, indicating a clear risk threshold.
- Certain regions generate revenue but contribute disproportionately to losses.

---

## Decisions Supported
This dashboard enables leaders to:
- Cap discounts for low-margin categories.
- Protect high-margin products from blanket promotions.
- Prioritize corrective actions in loss-heavy regions.
- Shift performance tracking from revenue growth to profit sustainability.

---

## Outcome
The dashboard provides a concise, executive-ready view that supports **actionable decisions**, risk mitigation, and strategic prioritization without requiring deep technical interpretation.
