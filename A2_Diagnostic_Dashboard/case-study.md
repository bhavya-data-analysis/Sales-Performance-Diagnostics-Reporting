# Sales Performance & Profit Risk Dashboard — Case Study

## 1. Business Question

Organizations often observe changes in revenue without a clear understanding of the underlying drivers. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate sales performance and profitability over time, identify areas where discounting may be negatively impacting profit, and highlight regions or product segments that contribute disproportionately to gains or losses.

The key questions addressed were:

* How are sales and profit trending over time?
* Which products and regions contribute most to revenue and profit?
* Where does aggressive discounting create profit risk?

## 2. Data Overview

The analysis uses an order-level sales dataset containing information such as order date, revenue (sales), profit, discount rate, product category and sub-category, region, and geographic location. The dataset structure allows performance to be evaluated across time, products, and regions while linking discount behavior directly to profitability outcomes.

The dashboard is designed to work with similarly structured sales datasets, enabling the same analytical framework to be reused across different scenarios.

## 3. Analytical Approach

The dashboard applies a structured analysis workflow:

* **Key Metrics**: Total sales, total profit, order volume, and average discount are calculated to provide a high-level performance snapshot.
* **Trend Analysis**: Sales and profit are aggregated monthly to identify growth patterns, volatility, and potential divergence between revenue and profitability.
* **Product Intelligence**: Revenue and profit are analyzed by category and sub-category to highlight strong performers and loss-driving segments.
* **Geographic Performance**: Regional and state-level views identify concentration of revenue and profit across locations.
* **Discount Risk Analysis**: Orders are evaluated by discount level to assess the relationship between discounting and profit outcomes.

## 4. Key Findings

Several consistent patterns emerged from the analysis:

* Sales growth is not always accompanied by profit growth, particularly during periods of aggressive discounting.
* Certain product categories generate strong revenue but contribute disproportionately to profit loss.
* High-discount orders (typically above 30%) account for a significant share of negative-profit transactions.
* Technology-related products show stronger and more stable profitability compared to heavily discounted furniture and supply items.

## 5. Risk Areas Identified

The discount analysis highlights clear areas of risk:

* Deep discounting leads to diminishing returns and, in many cases, negative profit.
* Profit leakage is concentrated within specific product sub-categories rather than evenly distributed.
* Without monitoring discount impact alongside profit, revenue growth can mask underlying financial risk.

---

## 6. Recommendations

Based on the observed patterns, the following actions are recommended:

* Review and reduce discounting in consistently low-margin product segments.
* Protect high-performing, high-margin products from unnecessary promotional pressure.
* Track sales, profit, and discount metrics together on a regular basis to detect early signs of profit erosion.

## 7. Outcome

This dashboard provides a repeatable framework for evaluating sales performance and profit risk. By combining trend analysis, product and regional breakdowns, and discount impact assessment, it enables decision-makers to move beyond surface-level revenue metrics and focus on sustainable profitability.
